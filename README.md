The idea of this application is very simple - give the opportunity for the customer of rim shop to "online fitting" rims on his own car. 

- Upload a photo of the car
- Specify the diameter of the circle with two clicks
- Browse rims

If you want to try the application but you don't have a photo of the car - don't worry. I am sharing the sample photo in the "sample photo" folder.

## What do we have here?

The application uses Vue js. It is made of components that communicate with each other. Data on rims (photos, name, price, description, category) may come from an external source, e.g. api of an online store.
